In this workshop the participants will familiarize themselves with over 30 alternative economic models that are in practice throughout the world today. After analyzing the current economic and structural issues apparent in our places of work and study, participants will be asked to imagine and consider the implications of using these alternative models to augment, remedy, or perhaps replace the current structure altogether.; About: Arts & Labor’s Alternative Economies Working Group is focused on researching alternative economic models that can be used to create and nurture more equitable and sustainable art worlds. Believing that vibrant creative communities come from the bottom up, they encourage relationships based on mutual aid rather than competition and advocate for cultural institutions rooted in a framework of social, economic, and environmental justice.

Film slides are now a rare means of illustration in the classroom, and virtually every arts employment or grant application requires the submission of images in digital form. But, despite the ubiquity of the medium, there remains a great deal of confusion. What is a “JPEG” file, exactly? What is image resolution, and how should it be specified? How are print resolution and screen resolution related? What are color profiles and are they important? How does all this apply to Power Point? What are the best methods for scanning existing images? Should archival digital files be kept in a specific format? This workshop will answer these questions in detail and will help both those who need to specify image parameters and those attempting to meet them. Participants will be provided with online reference resources."

This panel will bring together artists, cultural producers and organizations who have created original frameworks for themselves. We’ll discuss the “hows” and “whys” for creating new avenues of opportunity and definitions of success. Building communities, activism, collaborations and the use of current technologies will factor in the conversation. Come and participate in this discourse about how to thrive and stay sane in a ever increasing fickle art world.; Panelists; Susan Clausen, AS220; Larry Ossei-Mensah, The MEDIUM Group; Steve Englander, ABC No Rio; Amelia Winger-Bearskin, independent artist, Tisch School of the Arts, ITP, NYU"

It should clearly state what is expected of the student and the professor’s requirements for the course. In addition, various accrediting bodies and associations have their own requirements that may need to be addressed. Learn what should go into a syllabus and how to break down the course content into individual class sessions. The components of an effective lesson plan, and how to use it as a successful teaching document, will also be discussed. Issues to be addressed include how much can actually be accomplished in a single class period, what homework and/or preparations are needed for the next class session, classroom management issues, and strategies for success. A well-constructed syllabus can be a valuable teaching tool and an aid to the faculty member regarding student grade disputes. This course is invaluable for graduate TAs, recent MFA graduates who have just landed their first teaching positions, and anyone who would like a refresher on the finer points of setting up the term’s classes."

Negotiating matters such as pedagogical performance, the collegial support system, student evaluations, professional development, and the retention and tenure process can all prove daunting. My experience as a faculty member in higher education has provided me with considerable knowledge and insight into these issues, especially in the training and mentoring of part-time art instructors and new faculty members. In the workshop, issues to be presented and discussed include the following: constructing an effective syllabus; interaction with students, colleagues, and administrators; the importance of university policy on ownership of instructional and professional materials; plagiarism, student disabilities, grievances, and sexual harassment; and grading and student evaluation."

Since the academic world is fluid (because of frequent changes of administrators and university policies), tenure-track faculty need to develop sound strategies to make the most of the probationary period. The workshop covers the documentation of one’s activities, gaining an understanding of terms like regional, national, and international recognition, developing nationwide relationships in preparation for the tenure review, and identifying nonadversarial ways of getting clarification of job expectations. Some institutions are great at identifying their criteria for promotion, yet others lag behind due to frequent changes in leadership and shifting thresholds for tenure. This session is useful for both studio faculty and art historians who hold tenure-track positions. Those who are seeking a tenure-track position will find it interesting as well."

Developed by The Alliance for Networking Visual Culture at the University of Southern California, Scalar allows scholars to assemble media from multiple sources and juxtapose that media with their own writing in a variety of ways; to annotate video, audio, images, source code, and text using the platform’s built-in media annotation tools; and to structure essay- and book-length works in ways that take advantage of the unique capabilities of digital writing, including nested, recursive, and non-linear formats. The workshop will first cover basic features of the platform, including a review of existing Scalar books and a hands-on introduction to paths, tags, annotations, and importing media, and then move onto more advanced topics including the effective use of visualizations, annotating with media, and a primer on customizing appearances in Scalar."
